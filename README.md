# Mushroom Neural Network

Neural Network trained to distinguish images and categorize them between four categories of mushrooms, separated in edible and poisonous and each divided in sporocap and mushroom sporocap. 

This project uses Tensorflow to create the model and the dataset "edible and poisonous fungi" uploaded in Kaggle by Marcos Volpato.

## Current State

Right now the project has a working model (Although it's not yet as accurate as the project aims to achieve), the data set being used separated in the train and test sets, an image data generator to increase the amout of data used to train the model and of course the preprocessed data that is used to train and test the model. This section will be updated as the project progresses.
